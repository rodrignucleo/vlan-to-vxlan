	abstract = {The Software Defined Networking ({SDN}) paradigm is rapidly emerging as a viable alternative in the realm of Next Generation Internet of Things ({NG}-{IoT}) due to the inherent challenge posed by traditional computer networks. {SDN} is revolutionizing traditional network architecture by significantly reducing the reliance on hardware. One of the key challenges of implementing {SDN} in {NG}-{IoT} is the extensive communication that occurs between the switches and the controllers due to the bursty nature of the traffic. Therefore, it is crucial to explore solutions aimed at minimizing this control overhead caused by excessive communication. To alleviate the burden on {SDN} controllers caused by switches, we propose a new method, named {LSDA}, which can effectively reduce the flow of control information. To promote fairness within the network, packets heading towards the same controller are aggregated, thereby eliminating the need for complex disassembly in the case of different destination controllers. The simulation results demonstrate that {LSDA} can effectively reduce the packet loss ratio while simultaneously improving network delay and jitter.},

	abstract = {Eavesdropping attacks have seriously threatened network security. Attackers could eavesdrop on target nodes and link to steal confidential data. In the traditional network architecture, the static routing path and the important nodes determined by the nature of network topology provide a great convenience for eavesdropping attacks. To resist monitoring attacks, this paper proposes a random routing mutation defense method based on dynamic path weight ({DPWRRM}). It utilizes network centrality indicators to determine important nodes in the network topology and reduces the probability of important nodes in path selection, thereby distributing traffic to multiple communication paths, achieving the purpose of increasing the difficulty and cost of eavesdropping attacks. In addition, it dynamically adjusts the weight of the routing path through network state constraints to avoid link congestion and improve the availability of routing mutation. Experimental data shows that {DPW}-{RRM} could not only guarantee the normal algorithmic overhead, communication delay, and {CPU} load of the network, but also effectively resist eavesdropping attacks.},

Traditional network architecture only offers best-effort services which cannot meet the stringent delay and jitter requirements. In this paper, we propose a resilient-priority queue scheduling algorithm ({RPQ}) for delay-sensitive services. {RPQ} can guarantee stable delay in a fine-grained manner. Particularly, on the premise of meeting the delay requirements of high priority streams, {RPQ} can give consideration to the delay requirements of lower priority streams depending on its resilient scheduling mechanism. We implement {RPQ} on programmable switch. The experimental results show that {RPQ} not only guarantees {QoS} with low delay and low jitter for delay-sensitive streams but also improves network throughput by comparing with the existing solutions, i.e., {SP}-{PIFO} and {WRR}.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, many applications need varying levels of Quality of Service ({QoS}). The network that provides the communication service connects the servers and clients. The network traffic which is routed through the network should be engineered. Traffic Engineering ({TE}) is a mechanism for transferring the packets considering the different {QoS} level requirements among applications. The optimal resource allocation is the primary strategy for {TE} so that the network can provide the {QoS} requirements for each application. The {TE} can improve network efficiency, performance, and user satisfaction. Software Defined Network ({SDN}) has been proposed as the novel network architecture that could make networks agile, manageable, and programmable using control and data plane separating compared to traditional network architecture. In this paper, we survey network traffic engineering in {SDN}. We investigate and cluster the articles published between 2017 and 2022 on traffic engineering in {SDN}. The state-of-the-art articles about the traffic engineering mechanisms in {SDN} have been examined and classified into four types: topology discovery, traffic measurement, traffic load balancing, {QoS}, and dependability. Finally, the cutting-edge issues and challenges are discussed for future research in {SDN}-based {TE}.},

This {SLR} proposed the layered solution under consideration of advances and threats of technology, in which each layer finds the varying security attacks, its causes, and their proposed solutions.

Apparently, packet transmission efficiency depends on their deployment scenarios; indeed, the more flexibility often translates to the better user experience for the end-user in critical situations. In this work, we propose an automatic bridging system for mobile wireless backhaul designed for high flexibility and compatibility. It features a fully automated establishment of wireless backhaul links, supported by a {VXLAN}-based packet transmission pipeline and an auto-binding mechanism. We prototype the system on Linux-based operating system with standard packages to ensure the compatibility operation and {WiGig} modules; the evaluation demonstrates that the {VXLAN}-based system can achieve lower latency, with a reduction ranging from 15\% to 38\% compared to the static forwarding-based system.},

	abstract = {The integration of private fifth-generation (5G) networks with standardized publish-subscribe ({PubSub}) communication models offers clear benefits for Industry 4.0 applications. While {PubSub} models ensure vendor-neutral interoperability, backward compatibility, and mature information modeling, the use of 5G non-public networks ({NPN}) provides dedicated coverage, exclusive capacity, intrinsic controllability, and customized service and operation. In addition, the combination of {PubSub} protocols and 5G provides a complete communication stack for industrial automation, where {PubSub} protocols operate on higher {OSI} layers, and 5G operates on lower layers. However, the practical implications of the integration of {PubSub} models with 5G systems remain largely unaddressed in the existing literature. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper presents the first empirical evaluation of the integration of private 5G with a {PubSub} protocol, namely open platform communication unified architecture ({OPC}-{UA}), in a real production environment. The proposed solution for 5G and {OPC}-{UA} integration relies on layer 2 (L2) connectivity over a virtual extensible local area network ({VXLAN}) tunnel. Evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of such integration in the context of a soft real-time additive manufacturing ({AM}) use case for laser metal deposition ({LMD})-based manufacturing.},

Since overlay networks are much more complex than underlay networks, overlay network monitoring is more significant and challenging. In-band Network Telemetry ({INT}) can achieve fine-grained network monitoring by encapsulating data plane states into probe packets. However, as an underlying device-level primitive, {INT} cannot be directly applied to overlay network monitoring given underlay networks and overlay networks are generally transparent from each other. In this work, we propose {VXLAN}-based {INT}, a telemetry system for overlay network monitoring based on {VXLAN}. By inserting the {INT} metadata collected from the underlay devices into the {VXLAN} payload, we successfully build the real-time overlay-underlay association at the controller, through which, one can easily localize the root cause of overlay path congestion within a simple database lookup.},

The increasing popularity of software-defined networks ({SDN}) and the related technologies have shattered the realm of corporate infrastructures. The traditional approach for employees to access the corporate headquarter data centers has experienced challenges due to the significant traffic volume and delay, as more services have been moved to the cloud, e.g., Software-as-a-Service ({SaaS}). Tunnel-splitting can mitigate the problem, but it is mostly static. The paper proposed a dynamic on-demand tunnels approach based on Extensible {LAN} Tunnels ({VXLAN}) and {SDN}. The primary objectives are to reduce the load on corporate network and delay for users to access {SaaS}. We conducted experiments for feasibility study using Mininet and the results showed that the delay could be significantly reduced and the approach allows for a single point of policy management, which it still preserved the benefit of split tunnels.},

	abstract = {Fieldbusses have been the backbone of inter-device communication in both industrial and home automation settings for a few decades. The underlying assumption is the availability of reliable and low-latency communication for all busses. This often implies that the busses are confined to a single physical location. With the advent of the 'Internet of Things' ({IoT}) and succinctly the 'Industrial Internet of Things' ({IIoT}) and the increased demand for control logic to be pushed into the 'Cloud', that assumption can no longer be upheld. Since no (I){IoT} protocol exists to provide remote control, let alone in a secure fashion, while providing low latency at the same time, we are left with the problem of routing fieldbusses from, say, data-centres to shop-floors. This presents a challenge, because those busses have been designed for safety rather than security. In this paper, we elaborate on the viability of routing layer two fieldbus traffic while providing both: low latency to fulfil real-time requirements and security through cryptographic tunnels. We design and implement a network topology where Profinet traffic is routed through a {VXLAN} over Wireguard overlay to control a {SoftPLC} instance. We evaluate our implementation in a realistic test-bed and our measurements indicate that bridging Profinet over {VXLAN} and Wireguard induces a latency low enough for running time-critical applications.},

	abstract = {Virtual Extensible Local Area Network is an overlay technology that allows smart encapsulation of layer two through layer three. It provides the extension of Virtual Local Area Network domains, allowing the original addressing of virtual hosts through the data centers and cloud computing networks. Furthermore, The traditional three-layer model data center architecture can be abandoned with a more efficient topology, known as Spine and Leaf. The Spine and Leaf topology offers low latency and high bandwidth, which are crucial for high-performance computing and cloud environments. Moreover, by incorporating {VXLAN} technology with the Spine and Leaf architecture, it will provide an effective network topology, which considers the demands of modern data center networks. This paper introduces the {VxLAN} Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol, Ethernet Virtual Private Network ({MP}-{BGP} {EVPN}), and provides a practical implementation using the Free Range Router with docker containers in a {GNS}3 environment.},

	abstract = {A software-defined-networking ({SDN})-based controller ({SeerEngine}-Campus) provides service intelligence. This controller sets up connections, enforces service levels, and automates operations in order to provide full policy management. When the H3C Application-Driven Campus ({AD}-Campus) solution {SD}- W {AN} architecture is used, it gives users secure network access through a variety of transport technologies. {EVPN} and {VXLAN} work together to make campus networks that can manage multiple {LANs} over {SDWAN} that are highly scalable, efficient, and flexible. Network operators can set up much bigger networks than they could with traditional Ethernet-based Layer 2 architectures by deploying common sets of policies and services across campuses. {EVPN}-{VXLAN} separates network infrastructure from services and applications specific to each department or customer. This idea of network virtualization makes it possible to keep traffic separate and to add services to any part of the network without having to use expensive methods like plumbing {VLANs}. To demonstrate this simulation concept, an experiment was set up with several procedures, beginning with setting up the experiment topology, configuring the devices, and obtaining the experiment results. From the {AD}-Campus Solution, three areas must be deployed: the underlying physical cable, development services on {SeerEngine} Campus, and finally the protocol for Service Deployment and Verification ({EIA}). This experiment gave us a typical network scenario and a modern way to implement a network architecture for connecting network access securely across multiple transport technologies using {AD}- Campus solutions.},

	abstract = {In recent years, {IP}-fabric has often been used in data center networks, which is a set of network equipment (usually switches) interacting via control protocols, which provides unified addressing, security, etc. services, as well as data delivery along the optimal route. With such an organization, the implementation of some services is transferred to the virtualization of network functions. This article suggests an effective way to implement virtualization of network functions and deliver traffic to it in the {IP} fabric of a data center. The method is based on {VPP} (Vector Packet Processing platform) and {FRR} (Free Range Routing), {VxLAN} (Virtual extensible local area network), {EVPN} (Ethernet {VPN}) and {ICMP} (Internet Control Message Protocol) technologies. The results of test measurements of the processing of various traffic on the data plane are shown. The results of experimental tests show that on Xeon Cascade Lake core, {VPP} technology produces a performance of about 20 Mpps with {IPv}4 traffic. Combinations of {IPv}4 lookup, {VxLAN}, Encap/Decap, and {ACL} (Access Control List) lookup processing show lower performance.},

This paper aspires to develop a suitable architecture model with Software-Defined Network and Network Function Virtualization as its core techniques that can render a cloud design for {VPN}.The proposed model consists of three parts that include forwarding plane, signaling \& control plane, and data plane. The forwarding plane contains a tunnel that can be accomplished with technologies such as {VPN}, {VXLAN}, etc., and policy information. The signaling \& control plane contains entire topology information, Bgp-evpn protocols, {SDN} controller functions, and {NFV} Orchestrator functions. The Data plane contains an open flow protocol and underlay network components such as distributed switch or router to handle L2-L4 rules. The model is evaluated using a simulation on a testbed with order processing and order orchestration of the cloud {VPN} feature.},

Implemented in P4, {InFaRR} is free of additional headers and network state heartbeats. {InFaRR} has four essential features not jointly found in other recovery mechanisms: Loop prevention, Pushback, Recognition and Restoration and Return to the main route. Tests in standard Fat-Tree and {AB} Fat-Tree topologies with failures in different scenarios showed positive results when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. In scenarios in which the other algorithms were able to recover, {InFaRR} presented fewer hops to bypass the failure when the Pushback, Loop Prevention and Recognition and Restoration mechanisms were used. In scenarios with multiple failures, {InFaRR} successfully rerouted where the others algorithms in some cases looped. The mechanism for returning to the main route allows to verify failures in remote links, making it possible to return to the main route without intervention from the control plane. Several evaluations were done comparing the results of {InFaRR} with the state-of-the art mechanisms, showing the capability of our fast rerouting algorithm in dealing with failures at the line-rate.},

	abstract = {In recent times, it has been witnessed that an increasing number of Internet connected devices impose an huge challenge on Internet of Thing ({IoT}) networks, which provides diverse and complex network services through edge computing empowered {IoT} terminals. A network service can be formally represented by Virtualized Network Function Forwarding Graph ({VNF}-{FG}) with the advent of Network Function Virtualization ({NFV}) technology. Previous researches mainly focus on {VNF}-{FG} embedding ({VNF}-{FGE}) and take {VNF}-{FG} as the input. In this paper, we investigate the design of {VNF}-{FG}, which is required to be a Directed Acyclic Graph ({DAG}) and achieved by the {IoT} terminal, in two scenarios. In static scenario, for a set of traffic flows arriving at the {IoT} terminal and requesting different network services, an {ILP} model P$_{\textrm{s}}$ including loop prevention constraints is well formulated. An approximation algorithm {AFGC} with competitive ratio O(1+({\textbar} R{\textbar}-1) {\textbackslash}sigma ), {\textbackslash}sigma ın (0,1) is then designed, which thoroughly search all key instances to run comprehensive loop break. In dynamic scenario for a flow request on the fly reaching an {IoT} terminal, an {ILP} model P$_{\textrm{d}}$ and another approximation algorithm {DFGU} with a competitive ratio Ołeft (1+{\textbackslash}frac {\textbar} {SC}\_r{\textbar}{\textbar} F\_r{\textbar}{\textbackslash}right ) are developed, giving priority to reuse of existing topology to generate an augmented {VNF}-{FG} of minimum size. Simulation results indicate {AFGC} and {DFGU} outperform state-of-art work, and the gap between each of the two algorithms and their respective {ILP} models is marginal.},
